**OSMbe is willing to take on paid consultancy work, for example a formal training on how to edit OpenStreetMap.**

# Why?

We want to use this as a way to fundraise and to give companies and governements the opportunity to collaborate directly with the OSMbe community in professional setting.

# How?

When a new question comes up, we will first ask the community, then the membership, then the board members, then companies. OSMbe needs to be the one to recommend who actually does the work. This way OSMbe can give a "seal of approval".

We will set a small overhead fee (15%, including a cut for OKBE) to support OSMbe itself. 
We do not really care if people "cut out the middleman", but they will not get the "official seal of approval" and won't be explictley asked about future questions if they do.

We will first try this out, only then start to advertise it.

We want to make sure there's a clear border between what we can do for free vs what is a paid service
- if there is a result expectation it is paid
- formal teaching is by default a paid service
- software development is by default paid
- thinking through processes is for free by default; unless it becomes more than a day of work

Open questions (discuss with Dries):
- can we pay for this kind of work? Probably through SmartBe or if people can invoice themselves, or perhaps an actual work contract 
- can we pay for  travel costs etc.?
- do we need to advertise that this is possible? > perhaps only after we tried this out
