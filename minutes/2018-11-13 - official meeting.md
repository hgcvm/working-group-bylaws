## Notes

On November 13th last year, we had an official meeting. We called for this meeting through our membership list. We had 223 members who had been a member for at least 60 days at the time of meeting. 
For this meeting, we tried to allow both online and offline participation. This does not really work. Next time we might try a VOIP solution. 

Meetings are only official if at least 25% of the membership participate. That means we needed at least 56 people involved. We only had 12 participants, so this is a problem. To solve this, we will also allow for a digital vote after the meeting. 
We will consider the digital vote after the meeting part of the meeting to be able to reach quorum.

However, this low participation rate is a problem. As a solution, we suggested to introduce two membership classes. 

* Core/voting member

    > has voting right

    > need to go to (digital) official meeting (not all of them but most of them)

    > should be involved!

    > can't be anonymous

    > list displayed on https://members.osm.be

    > OSM username is optional

    > can't normally be refused

    > can speak in the name of OSM-be (with community@osm.be in CC)

* Regular Member

    > can't be anonymous

    > list displayed on https://members.osm.be

    > username is optional

    > wants to show public support for OpenStreetMap in Belgium


This should help limiting the core membership to more realistic numbers to get quorum. All members who were present at this or a previous meeting will be flagged as core member, as well as people who ask to be flagged on our chat group. If members do not show up for two consecutive official meetings (either online, offline or through voting), they will return to Regular Member status.

During any physical meeting, a significant minority (25%) can request to extend voting to absent Core Members.

If this is approved in the following digital vote, we will change the bylaws accordingly.

## Other agenda items

The occasion for this meeting was a vote on the proposed Code of Conduct. There was some discussion about this, but no opposition. The Code will only apply to OSM-be members on OSM-be channels. This does not include the mailing list talk-be nor the actions of members when they are not representing OSM-be.

The code itself: https://github.com/osmbe/working-group-bylaws
vote in person: 10 in favor, 0 against
vote online: 1 in favor, 0 against

This vote is also extended to the digital vote.


## Results of the digital vote

Even with the digital vote via Opavote, we did not reach quorum.
