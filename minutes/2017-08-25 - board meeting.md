# 2017-08-25 : Board meeting

Board members present (3/3) :

* Joost Schouppe
* Ben Abelshausen
* Jonathan BeliÃ«n

## Road mapping project
- now or never for software: by Sept. 8th we want to have a server running which takes input data and writes output. Jonathan will set up a server where Kay can do this. Joost will pass along the deadline. 
- there will be a more technical presentation on the project at Foss4g
- at the AIV Trefdag we want to be able to show more analysis; Jonathan and Joost will work on that together

## Funding portal 

* Jonathan explored Patreon, and it looks really intersting. Basically, you can set targets for a fixed montly income. If you make a certain amount, you promise to do something. Example (total budget mentioned):
- 50 euro a month: monthly meetup (use: train tickets for volunteers)
- 100 euro: 2 hackatons (pay a location, pay food and drinks, pay train tickets and such for volunteers)
- 150: 3 hackatons
- 400: one student open summer of code project
- 650: two students at open summer of code

The site also allows to give gifts to sponsors. Ideas :
    - goodies; t shirt if you sponsor and come to meetup (with Artisans Cartographes?)
    - logo on website
    
* Joost will ask Dries again about the Open Belgium crowdfunding platform.


## Foss4g.be
There are several interesting proposals, so we can probably fill an entire OSM track.
- Road mapping 
- Giacomo/Jo: PT_assistant + Jo: workshop on PT
- Julien: landuse (Virge?)
- Trage Wegen
- Anyways/mobility + itinero (Ben)

We've invited the Open Summer of code people; and both Joost & Jonathan are considering a proposal

Joost will suggest to the team that Dries might do a short introduction of Open Summer of Code
