# OSM Belgium - Working group bylaws

This repository contains simple bylaws, rules, to govern our OSM Belgium working group. OSM Belgium is part of Open Knowledge Belgium VZW that serves as an umbrella organization for us. This means our bylaws are just for our group, have no realy 'legal' meaning, just serve to govern our group.
